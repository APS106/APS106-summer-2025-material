    "\n",
    "You just finished your APS106 midterm and heading to dinner with a few friends. However, no one can decide what to eat. Recently, your friends have been watching the Big Bang Theory and are planning on using Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock to decide.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, to truly make the game truly random, you will not be playing each other, you will be playing against a computer and the person with the best record against the computer decides what to eat. Thus, write a Python program that using conditional statements and user input to play Rock-Paper-Lizard-Spock against a computer program with random choice selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that you are hungry! Make sure your code is efficient, well-thought-out, and accounts for all possibilities.\n",

    "## Define the problem\n",
    "Given the spin on the classic rock-paper-scissors-game, we must develop a Python program with user input, with random computer choice selection, that obeys the game's rules, and accounts for all possible scenarios to be as comprehensive as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difficulty in this problem lies in the implementation of the game with the comparison of randomly generated computer selections to string  user input. Do we want to use many if-statements? How do we want to handle the computer's choice? Let's consider some test cases first.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that: 1) we are doing this AFTER our APS106 midterm so #cleancode is fresh in our mind; and most importantly, 2) we are starving."

    " 2) The opposite of 1), where we convert user input of \"rock paper scissors, lizard or spock\" into numbers to compare with the computer selection to pick who wins.\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Get RPLS selection from the user\n",

    "3. Generate random number input from computer\n",
