    "If you want to buy a house, you need to find houses that are for sale. The multiple listing service (MLS) is a real estate listings service in Toronto that is updated throughout the day with new listings. The service has limited capabilities with housing listed by district, rather than particular streets. It would be much more convenient for the user to be able to input a list of streets and see all the houses for sale on those streets. Your goal is to take the current listings and create such an app. "
